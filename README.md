# My Personal Project: Movie/TV Watchlist

## Personal Watchlist Application

This application will function similarly to a wishlist, but for movies and TV shows.
Users will have their own personal **watchlist**, where they will be able to add movies or shows they want to watch to the list.
Other **features** of the watchlist users can use include removing movies from the list, mark a movie as watched,
give a movie a score, and display the list based on user preference. 

Anyone who wants an application to keep track of movies/shows they want to watch can benefit from using this application.
The *functionality* of this application can also be applied to other things like books or video games.

Although many of the big streaming services have a watchlist function on their platform, there are still many limitations. Firstly, 
in order to access watchlist the user must be a subscriber and continues to do so if they wish to access their watchlist. Secondly, 
no streaming platform have all the movies/shows. If the user wants to watch a show that is not available on this platform then they will not be able
to add it to their watchlist. As someone who loves watching movies and TV shows, not having a watchlist I can access anytime and add any movies to can be
frustrating at times. This is why I decided to create this project.
